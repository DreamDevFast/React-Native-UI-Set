**Notes on Contribution**

As you create new or update existing components you need to write a test for
them and fit a demo of them into the Kitchen Sink app.

**Notes on Structure**

You can find the raw Carbon Native components under `./src` the Kitchen Sink
demo app screens can be found under `./screens` and the tests for both `src` and
`screens` can be found under `__tests__`.

**Notes on Deployment**

To deploy Carbon Native we use a shell script (`publish.sh`) that ultimately
just publishes to NPM. Only specified organizations admins should have access to
publish on NPM:

* Tyler Buchea
* Josh Buchea

To deploy the Kitchen Sink app to Expo you will need the Expo CLI tool `npm
install -g exp` after that you can run `exp publish`. Only specified
organizations admins should have access to publish on Expo:

* Tyler Buchea
* Josh Buchea
